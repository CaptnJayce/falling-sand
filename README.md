### Requirements:
Ensure you have [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/b) and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) installed on your system

I recommend installing gcc via your package manager or with MinGW

For Arch Linux:
```
pacman -S clang raylib
```

For Windows:\
[Windows](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)\
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

### Running:
cd into repository
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake --build .
./FallingSand
```
